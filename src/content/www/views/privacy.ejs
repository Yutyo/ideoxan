This Privacy Policy applies to <a class="ts text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:text-gray-300 hover:underline" class="ts text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:text-gray-300 hover:underline" href="https://ideoxan.com/">https://ideoxan.com/</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://ideoxan.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</div>
                            <div class="mt-4">This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</div>

                            <div>Like most website operators, Ideoxan collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Ideoxan's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Ideoxan's visitors use its website. From time to time, Ideoxan may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</div>
                            <div class="mt-4">Ideoxan also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <a class="ts text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:text-gray-300 hover:underline" class="ts text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:text-gray-300 hover:underline" href="https://ideoxan.com/">https://ideoxan.com/</a>. Ideoxan only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</div>

                            <div>Certain visitors to Ideoxan's websites choose to interact with Ideoxan in ways that require Ideoxan to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Ideoxan gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at <a class="ts text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:text-gray-300 hover:underline" class="ts text-gray-700 hover:text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:text-gray-300 hover:underline" href="https://ideoxan.com/">https://ideoxan.com/</a> to provide a username and email address.</div>

                            <div>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

                            <div>Ideoxan discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Ideoxan's behalf or to provide services available at Ideoxan's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Ideoxan's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Ideoxan will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Ideoxan discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Ideoxan believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Ideoxan, third parties or the public at large.</div>

We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Ideoxan takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</div>
